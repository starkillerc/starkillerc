# 👋 Hi, I’m @starkillerc

🧠 I like to reverse systems, optimize them, or break them — in a good way.  
💻 I code in C++, Python, SQL, PL-SQL and JavaScript.  
🔍 I explore protocol flaws, system architecture, and efficient data handling.  
🛠 I build tools that help people understand how systems really work.
